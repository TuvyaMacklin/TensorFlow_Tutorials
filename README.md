# # TensorFlow_Tutorials
This is a collection of python scripts that were written while learning to use TensorFlow for computer vision problems.

## Utils
Of relevance to people going through the same tutorials is the collection of utility functions I wrote up. These provide many helpful functions for plotting examples, plotting model histories, saving and loading models and more.

## Plot Utils
Functions:
- `plot_accuracy(history)`: Creates a plot of the accuracy of a model with respect to the epochs. 
- `plot_history(history)`: Creates a plot of the history of a model with respect to the epochs. 
- `plot_images(rows, cols, images, label)`: Plots a grid of images. 
- `plot_examples_from_dataset(dataset, num_of_examples)`: Plots examples from a dataset.
